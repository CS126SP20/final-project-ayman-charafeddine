# Development

---

**Week 1**
- Created Card class that stores Suit and Rank enums and has getters and a function to get the point value of a card according to likha rules.
- Created Deck class that stores a stack of Card objects and has a Draw function that pops and returns the top Card as well as a size function.
- Wrote unit tests for Card and Deck classes
- Started seeing how to make the GUI work and created a function that draws cards being dealt (still needs to be worked on)
- Started to get ImGui set up
